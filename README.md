# DeepLearning-CNN-Brain-Stroke-Prediction

## Description
This project utilizes a Deep Learning model built with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict strokes from CT scans. The goal of this project is to aid in the early detection and intervention of strokes, which can lead to better patient outcomes and potentially save lives.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of CT scans from Kaggle, which includes both positive (stroke) and negative (no stroke) AKA normal cases.

## Model
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network, a class of deep learning models, that has proven to be highly effective in areas such as image recognition and classification. CNNs are particularly good at picking up on patterns in the input image, such as lines, gradients, circles, or even eyes and faces. It's this property that makes convolutional networks so powerful for computer vision tasks.
